# Clockoo

⏱️ A lightweight macOS menu bar app for Odoo time tracking.

No Electron. No browser. Just a native Swift app sitting in your menu bar, showing your active timers and letting you start/stop/pause with a click.

Part of the Odoo tooling family: [vodoo](https://github.com/julian-r/vodoo) (CLI) · [ghoodoo](https://github.com/julian-r/ghoodoo) (GitHub sync) · **clockoo** (time tracking)
